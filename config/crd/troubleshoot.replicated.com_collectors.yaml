                  settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no

                  resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user
                  may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will
                  react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers
                  in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard
                  termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
                  remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions,

                  or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated.
